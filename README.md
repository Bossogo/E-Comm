# E-Comm
A modern e-commerce web application built with Next.js, inspired by the E-comm App Kit (Community) design. In this project I implemented a modular architecture, dynamic routing, and responsive UI components tailored for online retail experiences. It includes product listings, cart functionality, payment flows, and user account managementâ€”perfect for developers looking to prototype or launch a scalable storefront.
